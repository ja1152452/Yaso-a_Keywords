## Overview
This is a Python-based calculator program that can perform multiple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program also allows the user to reset the result and quit the application. It uses a class-based structure to encapsulate the logic of the calculator and incorporates multiple Python keywords to demonstrate different programming concepts.

## Features
1. **Add**: Allows the user to add multiple numbers.
2. **Subtract**: Allows the user to subtract multiple numbers.
3. **Multiply**: Allows the user to multiply multiple numbers.
4. **Divide**: Allows the user to divide numbers, with error handling for division by zero.
5. **Reset Result**: Resets the calculator's result to zero.
6. **Quit**: Exits the program.

## Python Keywords Used
The following Python keywords have been used in the program to demonstrate various features and functionalities:

- **and**: Used in logical expressions (could be added in complex conditions).
- **as**: Used for exception handling (`except ValueError as e`).
- **assert**: Can be used for input validation (though not explicitly used here).
- **break**: Used to exit the `while` loop when the user selects the option to quit.
- **class**: Defines the `Calculator` class.
- **continue**: Could be used to skip further operations in a loop (optional).
- **def**: Used to define functions and methods.
- **del**: Not used in the current version but could be used to delete variables or objects.
- **elif**: Used to check multiple conditions (e.g., for operations like add, subtract, etc.).
- **else**: Used to handle the case where no conditions match.
- **except**: Handles exceptions, particularly for division errors.
- **False**: Could be used in conditional checks (though not used here).
- **finally**: Ensures that a block of code runs after `try` and `except`.
- **for**: Used to loop over lists of values.
- **from**: Not explicitly used in this program but could be used for importing specific modules.
- **global**: Not used here, but could be used for global variable modifications.
- **if**: Used for conditional checks to execute operations.
- **import**: Imports external modules (e.g., `import os`).
- **in**: Used for checking membership in sequences (e.g., `for value in values`).
- **is**: Used for identity comparisons (optional, but not used here).
- **lambda**: Could be used for defining anonymous functions (not explicitly needed).
- **None**: Represents the return value when no result is calculated (used in error handling).
- **nonlocal**: Not needed here, but could be used to modify variables in outer functions.
- **not**: Could be used for negation (e.g., `if not value`).
- **or**: Could be used for logical comparisons (e.g., `if choice == 1 or choice == 2`).
- **pass**: Could be used in an empty block to indicate no action (optional).
- **raise**: Used to raise exceptions, particularly when dividing by zero.
- **return**: Returns values from methods or functions.
- **True**: Represents true values in conditional checks.
- **try**: Starts a try block for exception handling.
- **while**: Used to repeatedly execute the program until the user quits.
- **with**: Could be used to manage resources (e.g., with file handling, not used here).
- **yield**: Not used in this program but could be used for generator functions.

## Usage
To run the program:
1. Clone or download the Python file.
2. Run the script using Python 3.
3. The program will display a menu where you can choose an operation to perform.
4. You can continue performing operations until you decide to quit by selecting option 6.
